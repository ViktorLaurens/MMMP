# MMMP (Multi-Manipulator Motion Planning)
MMMP stands for Multi-Manipulator Motion Planning. Created for a Masterâ€™s thesis in Electromechanical Engineering (Mechatronics and Robotics), this repository focuses on sampling-based motion planners, specifically combining Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM).

## Description
This repository is developed as part of a final dissertation to obtain the Master of Science in Electromechanical Engineering with a specialization in Mechatronics and Robotics. The project focuses on sampling-based motion planners, particularly combining Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM).
