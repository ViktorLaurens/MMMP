# MMMP (Multi-Manipulator Motion Planning)
This repository is developed as part of a final dissertation to obtain the Master of Science in Electromechanical Engineering with a specialization in Mechatronics and Robotics. The project focuses on sampling-based motion planners, particularly combining Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM).
